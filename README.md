# Consent Handling Prototype
A prototype for consent handling using a ethereum blockchain based on PoA and a small web server (express on node) to demonstrate the functionality.
## What is a consent?
**When one person voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another.**

This is a common use case when a company wants to perform processing of information collected from a person for a specific purpouse. For example: If a company collects data on a persons usage of a product with the intention of using that data to perform product improvements based on that data, the company needs to have a consent.

## User stories

From a company perspective:
- As a company I would like to be able to have a set of consent templates ready to generate new consents to offer our end users.
- As a company I need the consent template to specify a title, a body describing the purpouse of the consent and a purpouse for the consent.
- As a company I would like to generate a consent for a specific user based on a consent template that has a specific purpouse, language and country.
- As a company I would like to check to see if a user has accepted a specific consent.
- As a company I need to be able to provide a detailed audit trail of the consent handling for a specific user.
- As a company I expect the system to automatically generate new consents for the users if a consent template with the same purpouse as the initial consent is updated.
- As a company I need to be able to offer of withdraw a consent at any time.

From a user perspective:
- As a user I would like to know which consents I have been offered, are withdrawn, accepted, denied or defered.
- As a user I would like to be able to deny or accept a consent at any time.

## What does this prototype contains

A set of contracts written in Solidity that gives a web application the possiblity to create users and present to the user theese consents. It also gives the user the ability to accept, deny or defer the consents. The consents are generated by a company and added to the users file.

The blockchain has three contracts.

- ConsentFactory - A contract that is created for a company that allows the company to manage consent templates, generate new consents and add them to a users consent file. The templates supports versions, language, purpouse and jurisdiction (country).

- ConsentFile - A file that contains all the consents that have been offered to a specific user by the companies.

- Consent - A contract that allows a company to get consents from a specific user and for a specific purpouse. The user can agree, disagree or defer the decision on wether or not to accept it.

An simple express web server with a couple of pages to create new users and allow them to manage their consents during logins.

A couple of node javascripts to setup the ethereum blockchain, initiate a ConsentFactory and try out various use cases on the contracts.

## What needs to be done

This is just a few items that needs to be sorted out:
- Develop a GUI for the consent handling for both users and companies. (ongoing)
- How to handle integrity, i.e. wether or not a person has agreed or not is considered personal data. Maybe even the consent in itself.
- Is PoA the way to go, and if so who is the Authority in this case?
- Identity and proof of identity of the person is needed in the end.
- Signature, how to handle that on the consent or is it enough as it is? 2FA, etc.
- The contract model is that really the way to go? Need disucssions.
