## Consent Handling Prototype
An investigative  prototype for consent handling using an ethereum blockchain under a consortium type setup with proof-of-authority, a web server (express on node) and a mongo database for user registration.

See the ![wiki](https://github.com/dnulnets/consent/wiki) for full information on the solution.

**Disclaimer!** This is work in progress and do not by any means make any claims of being bug free, exhaustive or being a provider of a blockchain for this purpose. It contains a sample IT-service provided by a company, a set of public web applications for consent handling and registration, a PoA blockchain, source code and wiki describing the system analysis, information model, solution overview and contract model.

## What is a consent?
**When one person voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another.**

This is a common use case when a company wants to perform processing of information collected from a person for a specific purpouse. For example: If a company collects data on a persons usage of a product with the intention of using that data to perform product improvements based on that data, the company needs to have a consent.

## How to test the system on the test Consent Chain
This Consent Chain is run by Permobil AB and we make no claims of uptime or data retention of any sort. This is a prototype.
