## Consent Handling Prototype
An investigative  prototype for consent handling using an ethereum blockchain under a consortium type setup with proof-of-authority, a web server (express on node) and a mongo database for user registration.

It is in no way complete and there is no claim of it ever being completed. It is focusing on the process of handling consents on a blockchain and to learn the functionality, pros and cons supporting this use case.

**This is work in progress, but it is fully functional and allows you to create users, administrators, consent templates, consenst and accept or deny them.**

**Feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or if you want to suggest changes, ideas or whatever**

See the ![wiki](https://github.com/dnulnets/consent/wiki) for full information on the solution.

## What is a consent?
**When one person voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another.**

This is a common use case when a company wants to perform processing of information collected from a person for a specific purpouse. For example: If a company collects data on a persons usage of a product with the intention of using that data to perform product improvements based on that data, the company needs to have a consent.
